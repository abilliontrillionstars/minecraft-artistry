## MECHANICS ##
###############
1. keep a history of the spells the caster has selected (max 5(?))
    - mouse buttons (keybind, configgable) act like a previous-next
        Ex. player equips Shatter, then Radiance, then Rose Thorns
        | S R RT | -> 'back' key -> | S R RT | -> 'forward' key -> | S R RT |
        |------^-|                  |---^----|                     |------^-|

2. spells with modifiers need to be stored as tables
    - table entries are bools for mods enabled
        -name, state as num, and table of enable-mods
    - a changeSpell(spell) function
        - calls colorStaff()
        - sends message based on mod table

3. spell string parsing format
    "spellid-0-1-0"
    - staff spell splits by '-'
    - reads the first segment to discern id
    - additional numbers come from spell tables
        - past the first common 3 or 4 attributes  

4. gramary-roots.lua
    holds the tables for the roots spells
    - have gramary-hex and gramary-cantrips for similar
    (?) holds the actions for modifier manip
    - does NOT hold the actions for equipping spells
    changeSpell() is passed the table

5. Action Wheel Functions
    left-click equips, saves to history 
    right-click opens modifiers page
    functions on mod pages modify spell tables
