--Virtuoso Ink Magic Plans--
### Mechanics ###
Spells will mostly consist of animations that sling ink in the form of particle lines or splines. 
These animations are played by Figura, and hold instruction keyframes that send chat messages to 
cast hexes in time with them. Cassettes will be used to read property iotas to select the right 
action to take.

main page of the Action Wheel will start with 3 entries - TIME, MATTER, and ENERGY. these will
represent the Magentas, Cyans, and Yellows, respectively. Their icons will of course be the 
Amethyst, Citrine, and Topaz, with a fourth entry being unlocked when the grayscale pigments are 
introduced, bearing the <VOID> at first, then changing to <LIFE> at the peak of the playthrough.
these 4 actions will then link to 4 subpages (for the subhues under each 4 main hues), which will
then link to the spell lists.

depending on the selected spell, right-clicking with the paintbrush can cancel the use of the item
(thus not painting or slinging ink). we'll hook into events.use_item for this.

### Tenants of Pigment Magic ###
some spells will 'summon' a Spectrum tool while featuring a special model for them, likely with a 
look and feel similar to the paintbrush model. we'll call these "Brush Shifts". A brush shift will
enqueue a cassette to mishap out the held item, mediafy the brush, and return the specified item. 
this allows usage of some items to be preserved, saving on media usage and using Ink instead. for
example, instead of casting Overgrowth on a target, we brush shift into the Nature Staff. tossing 
out the shifted item will mediafy it and return the paintbrush as it were.
