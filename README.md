## About
this is a compendium of random texturing, modeling, and other art I've been doing over the years, showcasing various stages of experience. it also includes the embedded lua scripts for avatars making use of the [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura) mod.

### Use disclaimer
all the **code** here is open-source and free to be copied and/or used as examples or starting points for projects. this does _not_ apply to any mod jars or assets used as reference for texture packs; these belong to and are under the license of their respective owners.

all the **art** here is made by myself, and has no official licensure applied to it. I'm not going to hunt you down if you steal it, but notice is appreciated. the former does *not* apply to reuploading my work on platforms as resource packs; I will go kesha on you. you may download the unfinished packs from here for personal use only. 

for Figura avatars as a whole, the two above principles apply. you may take any modeling and texturing assets from them but please do try to make them unique and not just use them as-is, since they're intended for my personal use. feel free to use them as inspiration!
